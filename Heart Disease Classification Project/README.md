  > A Jupyter Notebook project that works to classify wether or not a patient has heart disease given clinial parameters from a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
  > It tests and improves different scikit-learn machine learning models **(LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier)** using **pandas, numPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn** tools. Hyperparameters are tuned with scikit-learn's **RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV**.
