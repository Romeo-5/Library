# Library

This is a repository showcasing projects and coursework I have worked on. 

Current projects included in repository:
###  1. Classification Model
  > A Jupyter Notebook project. It tests and improves different classification machine learning models using pandas, numPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

###  2. Regression Model 
  > A Jupyter Notebook project that works to predict the price of bulldozers from a dataset provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview). It tests and improves the scikit-learn RandomForestRegressor regression model using pandas, numPy, matplotlib, and other scikit-learn tools. Hyperparameters are tuned with scikit-learn's RandomizedSearchCV, and the results are used to train a model with the best parameters.    

###  3. SCU 
  > A folder containing work from my courses at Santa Clara University
