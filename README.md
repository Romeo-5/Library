###  1. Classification Model
  > A Jupyter Notebook project that works to classify wether or not a patient has heart disease given clinial parameters from a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). 
  > It tests and improves different scikit-learn machine learning models **(LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier)** using **pandas, numPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn** tools. Hyperparameters are tuned with scikit-learn's **RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV**.
###  2. Regression Model 
  > A Jupyter Notebook project that works to predict the price of bulldozers from a dataset provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview). 
  > It tests and improves the scikit-learn **RandomForestRegressor** regression model using **pandas, numPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn** tools. Hyperparameters are tuned with scikit-learn's **RandomizedSearchCV**.  

###  3. SCU 
  > A folder containing work from my courses at **Santa Clara University**
